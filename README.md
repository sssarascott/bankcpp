Project Description: C++ Banking System with Data Management
Overview
This project is a C++-based banking system designed to manage customer accounts, perform transactions, and log all data-related events for auditing and tracking purposes. The system is built around a clear, object-oriented architecture that models real-world banking operations through a set of interrelated classes. The core functionality includes account management, transaction processing, and a dedicated data management module for tracking changes and system events.
Objectives
•	Account Management: Enable banks to create, manage, and query various types of accounts (e.g., savings and checking).
•	Customer Handling: Allow customers to open and close accounts, while managing personal and account-related information.
•	Transaction Processing: Support basic operations such as deposits and withdrawals, ensuring accurate transaction logging (use LocalDateTime class).
•	Data Management: Record all critical events (like account creation, transactions, and updates) to facilitate system auditing and troubleshooting.
•	Extensibility: Provide a robust framework that can be extended with additional features such as loan management, online banking, and more.
System Architecture
The system is designed using a modular approach with a focus on maintainability and scalability. The key components are:
1.	Core Banking Classes:
o	Bank: Acts as the central manager for the entire banking system, responsible for handling account creation and providing access to accounts.
o	Customer: Represents the bank's customers and manages the relationships between customers and their respective accounts.
o	Account: A general class for bank accounts, encapsulating common attributes like account number, balance, and transaction history.
	SavingsAccount: A specialized account with additional properties like interest rate and methods for applying interest.

    * **CheckingAccount:** A specialized account that supports features such as an overdraft limit.
* **Transaction:** Models the individual transactions performed on an account, recording details such as transaction ID, amount, and date.
2.	Data Management Module:
o	DataManager: Responsible for maintaining a log of system events. It records entries for key operations within the system.
o	DataLogEntry: Represents a single log entry, including a unique entry ID, a timestamp, and a description of the event.
Class Responsibilities
•	Bank:
o	Manages a collection of accounts.
o	Provides methods to create new accounts and retrieve existing ones.
o	Integrates with the DataManager to log significant events such as account creation or system updates.
•	Customer:
o	Maintains customer-specific information.
o	Handles account operations for customers, such as opening and closing accounts.
o	Associates with multiple accounts.
•	Account (and its subclasses SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount):
o	Holds account-specific details such as balance and transaction history.
o	Implements core financial operations including deposits and withdrawals.
o	Uses inheritance to differentiate between account types and add specialized behavior (interest application, overdraft checking).
•	Transaction:
o	Captures the details of each financial transaction. 
•	Ensures that every operation on an account is recorded with accurate timestamps and unique identifiers.
•	DataManager and DataLogEntry:
o	DataManager: Collects and manages all log entries generated by various operations within the banking system.
o	DataLogEntry: Stores individual records of events, making it easier to audit and track data changes across the system.
Implementation Details
•	Language & Frameworks:
The project will be implemented in C++ using core C++ libraries. C++ Collections Framework will be used for managing lists (e.g., accounts and transactions), and C++ Date/Time API will handle timestamps.
•	Design Patterns:
The project utilizes object-oriented design principles such as inheritance and encapsulation. Additionally, the Singleton pattern may be used for the DataManager to ensure consistent logging across the system.
•	Error Handling & Validation:
Robust error handling mechanisms will be implemented to deal with potential issues like invalid account operations or failed transactions. Input validation will be incorporated throughout the system to maintain data integrity.
•	Extensibility:
The modular design allows for future enhancements, such as integrating online banking features, adding new account types, or connecting to an external database for persistent storage.
Conclusion
This C++-based banking system is designed to provide a clear and maintainable framework for managing accounts, processing transactions, and logging system events. Its modular architecture and adherence to object-oriented principles make it a solid foundation for both academic projects and potential enterprise-level applications. Future improvements can further enhance the system's functionality and scalability, making it adaptable to evolving banking requirements.
